[Adams,Michael]

1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 Bf5 4.Nf3 e6 5.Be2 Nd7 6.0-0 Bg6 7.c3 Nh6 [I noticed that Stuart normally doesn't challenge the centre directly on the Black side of the Caro-Kann. Here he chooses an interesting way to mobilise Black's minor pieces. If instead 7...Ne7 White has the option to go after the light squared bishop with 8.Nh4 . Taking the knight on h6 immediately didn't look promising to me although it's the most common choice. However it's a nice option to have available so I gained some space on the queenside.] 8.a4 Rc8 [I was expecting 8...a5 , the rook move isn't justified in the game as Black isn't able to make the c5 break.] 9.a5 a6 [There was a case for not fixing the queenside structure and playing 9...Be7] 10.Bf4 Be7 [At the moment the opening of the centre following 10...c5 11.c4 looks very dangerous for Black.] 11.Re1 0-0 12.b4 [I had hoped not to have to spend a tempo on this now but 12.Nbd2 c5 13.c4 Nf5! is fine for Black.] 12...f6 13.exf6 Rxf6 [I thought White had a small edge after 13...Bxf6 14.Bd3 Qe7 but it's not easy to say which capture is stronger.] 14.Bg5 It's important to drive the rook to a worse square. 14...Rf7 15.Bxh6 gxh6 16.Bd3 Bh5 [The most ambitious move 16...Rf6 17.Bxg6 (17.Ra2 Bd6 18.Rae2 Qe7 19.Bxg6 hxg6 20.Nbd2 Rcf8 is nothing special despite the apparently efficient manner in which I doubled my rooks.) 17...hxg6 18.Nbd2 Bd6 19.Nb3 Qe7 20.Nc5 is only a liitle better but will make for an unpleasant defensive task for Black.] 17.Nbd2 Nf8 [I felt this was the key moment in the game, now I get a grip on the position that I was able to maintain to the end of the game. Instead I was anticipating 17...Rf6! Stu was concerned about 18.Qc2 but (The computer suggestion 18.Re3 is stronger 18...Bd6 19.Qe1 Qe7 20.Ne5 but much less clearcut than the game.) 18...Bd6! giving up a pawn for activity isn't that clear 19.Bxh7+ (or 19.Ne5 Qc7 20.Ndf3 Rcf8! (we checked 20...Kh8 21.Nxd7 Qxd7 22.Ne5 Qg7 23.Re3 in the post mortem but the rook move is stronger) ) 19...Kh8 20.Ne5 Qc7 21.Nxd7 Qxd7 22.Bd3 Rcf8 and in both cases Black's forces are coordinating very well.] 18.Re5 Breaking the pin is very strong, all my pieces can mobilise freely and Black's structure starts creaking. 18...Bg6 [My opponent played this quite fast but 18...Bg5 was worth considering 19.h4 (19.Qf1 Bxf3 20.Nxf3 Rxf3 21.gxf3 Qf6 also makes White show some precision.) 19...Bxd2 20.Rxh5 Bxc3 21.Rb1 Qe7 doesn't look very healthy but Black will certainly get some material for his troubles.] 19.Bxg6 hxg6 20.Re3 [Retreating the rook is an important finesse as 20.Qc2 Bd6 21.Re2 Qf6 22.Rae1 is not so effective.] 20...Bd6 21.Ne5 Rf4 [Understandably Stuart didn't want to part with his best piece but 21...Bxe5 22.Rxe5 Qf6 does improve his coordination.; 
I was thinking about 21...Rf5 but the longer rook move aims to provoke g3 cutting off my rook's access along the third rank.] 22.Qe2 Rc7 23.Ndf3 Rf5 24.Re1 Rg7 25.g3 [I had an interesting alternative in 25.Nd3 Qe7 26.Nfe5 but thought that simpler measures were also strong.] 25...Be7 26.Kg2 Qc8 27.Qd2 Aiming to force the move h5 which gives my knights another outpost on g5. 27...Kh7 28.R3e2 Qd8 29.h4 h5 Black has to acquiesce as g4 was threatened.
 30.Nd3 Rgf7 31.Nfe5 Rg7 32.Nf4 Qc8 [The desperate sacrifice 32...Bxh4 33.gxh4 Qxh4 shouldn't work but there is some activity 34.Nh3 g5 35.Rh1 Ng6 36.Nxg6 Qg4+ 37.Kf1 Rxg6 38.Qd3 should be good enough.] 33.Nh3 [Maybe 33.Ned3 Rf6 34.Nh3 was more precise.] 33...Kg8 34.Re3 The rooks creep forward again so White's pieces can triple on the e-file in the right order. 34...Qc7 [Now was a good moment to try a break out 34...g5 35.Nxg5 Bxg5 36.hxg5 Rgxg5 37.Rf3 Qd8 38.Rxf5 Rxf5 was the best practical chance.] 35.Nf3 Rgf7 36.R1e2 [The rooks beat the queen after 36.Nfg5 Bxg5 37.Nxg5 Rxf2+ 38.Qxf2 Rxf2+ 39.Kxf2 but there is no reason to allow this.] 36...R7f6 [The e-pawn's number is also up after 36...Qc8 37.Qe1] 37.Nfg5 Qd7 38.Qe1 Bd6 39.Nxe6 Nxe6 40.Rxe6 Rxe6 41.Rxe6 Kf7 A pawn down with a pretty rotten position I thought the game would be over soon but Stuart puts up stiff resistance.
 42.Re3 Be7 43.Qe2 [For some reason I considered 43.Nf4 for a while before realising 43...Bxh4 was possible.] 43...Bd8 44.Qd3 [I could have got on with it with 44.f3 but I thought that changing the order of my major pieces and introducing the possibility of h6 would be enough to cause a collapse.] 44...Be7 45.Re2 Bf6 46.Qe3 Qe7 47.Qd2 Qf8 48.Nf4 [Now would have been a good moment for 48.f3] 48...Qc8 49.Nh3 [Both 49.Nd3 and; 
49.Ne6 were pretty good but I decided to go back to my previous idea.] 49...Kg7 [Stuart decides to vary as 49...Qf8 50.f3 Bd8 51.Qe3 Kg8 52.Nf4 Rxf4 53.Qxf4 Qxf4 54.gxf4 Kf7 55.f5 gxf5 56.Re5 Bf6 57.Rxf5 Kg6 58.Re5 is an easy win.] 50.Qe3 Qd7 [If 50...Kf7 51.Nf4 is deadly.] 51.Qe8 [51.Nf4 was still strong here.] 51...Qc7 [After 51...Qxe8 52.Rxe8 the b-pawn can't be protected.] 52.Re6 Qf7 53.Qc8 g5 [The last throw of the dice as 53...Be7 54.Re2 Bf6 55.f3 leaves Black move bound.] 54.Re2 [The alternative 54.hxg5 Bxg5 55.Rd6 Be7 56.Rd7 wasn't bad.] 54...Kg6 55.hxg5 [I pondered 55.f3 but the clinical way to take advantage of Black's cornered rook was; 
55.g4! hxg4 56.h5+ , exchanging everything is good enough.] 55...Bxg5 56.Nxg5 Rxg5 57.Qe6+ Kg7 58.Qxf7+ Kxf7 59.Re5 1-0

Adams,Michael (2737) - Nakamura,Hikaru (2793) [C65]
London Classic 7th London (5), 08.12.2015
[Adams,Michael]

I managed a new record in the London Chess Classic with 9 draws, this game had the potential to get exciting, but like a lot of other games in the event it faded away.
 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.Bxc6 dxc6 6.Nbd2 Nd7 7.Nc4 0-0 A recent concept,
 8.Bd2 White makes some developing moves and keeps the option to castle on both sides of the board. 8...Re8 9.Qe2 f6 [It is often more precise for Black to play 9...Bd6 as occurred in previous games such as Anand-Giri in Bilbao and also McShane- Georgescu from the LCC Rapid Open a week after this game. This seems logical as Black is ready for c6-c5 and transferring the knight to d4 via f8 and e6 or b8 and c6. However here after the continuation 10.g4 Nf8 11.Ne3 White can quickly develop a kingside initiative.] 10.h4 [The point of Hikaru's accurate last move is that 10.g4 is now well met by 10...Nb6; 
Maybe the caveman style 10.Rg1!? is another option for the fearless.] 10...Nf8 11.h5 White has gained some space and hopes to either transfer a knight to f5, or play g4 or h6 later on. 11...Be6 [I was expecting 11...Ne6 but developing the bishop is sensible.; 
11...Bg4 was another option.] 12.Ne3 Qd7 13.h6 [I was originally planning 13.Nh4 but didn't like 13...Bd4 however 14.Qf3 (14.0-0-0 Bxa2 looks hard to believe; or 14.Nhf5 Bxb2 15.Rb1 Bd4 16.Rxb7 Bb6 17.Qg4 deserve further investigation) ; 
After 13.0-0 Bxe3 14.Qxe3 h6 15.Nh4 Bg4 I was worried about dropping a pawn although this is also not that clearcut.; 
13.0-0-0 is no longer an option due to 13...Bxa2] 13...g6 14.0-0 Bg4 [14...Bf7 or; 
14...Rad8 were other sensible options.] 15.Nxg4 Qxg4 16.Nd4 [Perhaps 16.b4!? was a good idea, I was reluctant to weaken the queenside but it does speed up my kingside play: 16...Bd6 17.Nd4!? (17.Qe3!?) 17...Qxe2 18.Nxe2 Ne6 19.g3] 16...Qxe2 17.Nxe2 Ne6 18.g3 g5 White's position looks promising but the vulnerability of the pawn on h6 is very annoying.
 19.Be3 [White's king doesn't feel very comfortable after 19.Kg2 Kf7 (not 19...g4 20.f3) 20.f4 gxf4 21.gxf4 Rg8+ 22.Kf3 (22.Kh3 exf4 23.Nxf4 Nxf4+ 24.Bxf4 Rg6) 22...exf4 23.Bxf4; 
19.Kh2 Bf8 20.f4 gxf4 21.gxf4 Bxh6 22.Rf3 is uninspiring, but the computer thinks White has sufficient compensation] 19...Bf8 20.Kg2 Bxh6 21.Rh1 Bg7 22.Kf3 [The direct 22.Raf1 Re7 23.f4 is met by 23...f5 however there are some risks involved in my king sauntering up the board.] 22...h6 23.Kg4 [I originally planned to play for positional compensation with 23.g4 Kf7 24.Ng3 Rh8 25.Nf5 Rh7 26.Rh5 Rah8 27.Rah1 Bf8 28.Ke2 Kg6 29.b3 Ng7 30.Nxg7 Bxg7 leaves Black unlikely to find a breakthrough but it's more pleasant to have an extra pawn.] 23...Re7 24.Raf1 Rf8 25.Rh3 [I was intending 25.f4 but lost faith 25...exf4 26.gxf4 f5+ 27.exf5 Nd8 (27...Nxf4 28.Nxf4 Rxe3 29.Ne6 Rf7 30.Re1) 28.Rh3 Rfe8 29.Rff3 is hard to assess.; 
25.b3 could be a useful move.] 25...Nd4 [If 25...Ref7 the intrepid king move 26.Kf5 is an option although the knight is not attacked as 26...b6 27.Kxe6 f5 mates in 2.; 
25...f5+ 26.exf5 Nd4 is similar to the game.] 26.Nxd4 exd4 27.Bc1 Re5 [27...f5+ 28.exf5 Re2 29.f4 White's kingside play looks more important than the queenside pawns disappearing.] 28.f4 Rc5 29.Rh2 f5+ 30.exf5 Rfxf5 [The stronger capture as my king is forced back 30...Rcxf5 31.Re1 is comfortable for White.] 31.Rhf2 gxf4 32.Bxf4 h5+ 33.Kh3 Be5 34.Re1 Ra5 [It's hard to exploit the extra pawn as Black's queenside structure can't advance easily and White's rooks and king are active enough in a line like 34...Rd5 35.Re4 c5 36.Rfe2] 35.a3 Rd5 36.Re4 a5 37.a4 Rf7 38.b3 Bd6 [After 38...c5 39.Rfe2 Bxf4 40.gxf4 Rdf5 41.Kg3 progress remains elusive.] 39.Rfe2 Rg7 40.Bxd6 cxd6 41.Re8+ Kh7 42.Rf2 With the time control reached and the 2 open files under control I felt fairly safe. 42...Rdg5 43.Rf3 R5g6 44.Re4 Rg4 45.Re6 h4 [45...d5 46.Re5 R4g5 47.Re6 leads nowhere] 46.Rxd6 [46.gxh4 Rg1 47.Rf2 also holds.] 46...c5 [After 46...Rxg3+ 47.Rxg3 hxg3 48.Kg2 c5 49.Rb6 Black could even have to be careful.] 47.Rd5 Rxg3+ 48.Rxg3 hxg3 49.Kg2 b6 50.Rd6 Rg6 51.Rxg6 Kxg6 52.Kxg3 Kg5 53.Kf3 Kf5 54.Kg3 Kg5 55.Kf3 Kf5 56.Kg3 Ke5 ½-½

GBR-ch 97th Canterbury (10), 05.08.2010
[Adams,Michael]

1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.Bb5+ Simon doesn't play the Sicilian that often and had seemed unsure about this line in his past games but his next few moves came at a brisk rate as he whipped out the main line. 3...Bd7 4.Bxd7+ Qxd7 5.c4 Nf6 6.Nc3 g6 7.d4 cxd4 8.Nxd4 Bg7 9.f3 [The variation 9.h3 seems to have been killed off by the alert response. 9...Qc7 10.b3 Qa5 11.Bd2 Nxe4 12.Nxe4 Qe5] 9...0-0 10.Be3 The idea of White's play is to complete queenside development before castling to reduce the chances of a successful central break. 10...Rc8 [It's not clear the rook is well placed here 10...Nc6 was one sensible alternative.] 11.b3 e6 12.Rc1 d5 [This pawn move is premature 12...Nc6 13.0-0 d5 certainly gets closer to equality than the game. Black could also simply develop rather than breaking in the middle.] 13.e5 Ne8 [The piece sacrifice 13...Nh5 14.g4 dxc4 15.gxh5 Bxe5 16.hxg6 hxg6 doesn't convince.] 14.cxd5 exd5 [The alternative 14...Bxe5 15.dxe6 fxe6 16.0-0 leaves Black with a weak pawn and 16...Rd8? is well met by 17.Nxe6] 15.f4 Nc6 16.0-0 Nc7 [The computer recommends 16...Bf8 but 17.Nxc6 bxc6 18.f5 looks rather ominous.] 17.Nxc6! Given time to improve his pieces Black is ok so this tactical opportunity shouldn't be missed. 17...bxc6 18.Ne4 Transferring the knight to greener pastures due to the opposition of the queens. 18...Ne8 [I thought 18...a5 keeping the knight within touching distance of the useful outpost on e6 was better.; 
The immediate 18...Ne6 is strongly countered by 19.f5] 19.Nc5 Qe7 20.Nd3 An important withdrawal that I took a while to spot , now Black's steed will be stuck on the back rank for a while. 20...Qe6 21.Qf3 a5 [The weakening of the b6 square causes Black problems so 21...Bf8 was worth considering. However 22.Rc2 a5 23.Bc5 is not very pleasant.] 22.Nc5 [I considered 22.g4 but such drastic measures aren't required 22...f5 is a reasonable response.] 22...Qe7 23.Bf2 [I felt 23.Rc2 was the right move as 23...Nc7 (but 23...f6 seemed like an interesting option for Black.) 24.Na4 is very good] 23...Rab8 [Now 23...Nc7 is refuted by 24.Na4; 
and 23...f6 24.Bh4 also keeps control.] 24.Qh3! Introducing a threat of d7 and the option of h4. 24...f5 It was getting difficult for Black to move anything but this leaves White with a passed e-pawn to go with his other trumps.
 25.Qc3 Ra8? [I thought Simon should try 25...Qd8 26.Bd4! (The impatient 26.Ne6 Qd7 27.Nxg7 Nxg7 28.Qxa5 Ne6 allows Black's knight to find a dream square) 26...Bf8 (the best practical chance is 26...Nc7 27.Qxa5 Bf8) 27.Ne6 Qd7 28.Nxf8 Kxf8 intending to bring his knight to e6 but 29.e6! Qxe6 30.Rfe1 tears Black's position in two.; 
It was also worth considering 25...Rb5 keeping everthing covered for the moment.] 26.Na4 Ra6 [Giving up a pawn 26...Rab8 27.Qxa5 was relatively best this costs even more material.] 27.Qd3 Black resigned as material is dropping off 27...a7 28.xa7 xa7+ 29.h1 offers little hope. 1-0

Adams,Michael (2701) - Edouard,Romain (2649) [B51]
Biel blitz 53rd Biel (5), 25.07.2020
[Adams,Michael]

I don't usually annotate blitz games, but as I don't normally start a tournament with 9.5/10 either, I thought I would make an exception. Sadly normal service was resumed from then on, as I struggled to finish with 11/14. 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.Bb5+ Nd7 4.Ba4 Ngf6 5.0-0 Nxe4 Romain paused for a moment here, taking this very hot pawn is not a very clever idea, but often White will have to sacrifice more material to justify his play, which can easily go wrong in blitz. 6.Re1 Nef6 [6...d5 7.c4 Nef6 8.d4 opens the centre quickly. The pressure exerted by the rook on e1 and the bishop on a4 make it hard for Black to get his king to safety.] 7.d4 cxd4 [7...e6 is well met by 8.d5 e5 9.Nxe5! Be7 with a White edge.(9...dxe5? 10.Rxe5+ Be7 11.d6+-) ] 8.Nxd4 d5 [After 8...e6 9.Nb5! is annoying, or after; 
8...a6 9.Nf5 the knight creates problems from another direction.] 9.Bf4 a6 10.Nc3 e6 [The obvious 10...b5!? was perhaps a better try, now things are quite complicated, as there are so many tempting continuations. 11.Bxb5! axb5 now I was intending the imprecise 12.Ncxb5?! (12.Ndxb5! is correct 12...e5 13.Nxd5 Nxd5 14.Qxd5 the point- with White's queen in the game Black can't survive long. 14...Ra5 (14...Be7 15.Qxa8 exf4 16.Nd6++-) 15.Bxe5 Nxe5 16.Qxe5+ Be7 17.Nc7++-) 12...e5 13.Rxe5+ (13.Bxe5 Nxe5 14.Rxe5+ Be6 isn't very clear.) 13...Nxe5 14.Bxe5 Bg4 15.f3 Rc8 but Black is in the game here.] 11.Rxe6+ [Hard to resist but 11.Nxd5! Nxd5 12.Nxe6 fxe6 13.Qxd5 was best, threatening carnage on e6.] 11...fxe6 12.Nxe6 Qb6 13.Nc7+ Kf7 14.N3xd5! [The greedy 14.Nxa8? Qxb2 is much less impressive.] 14...Qa5 [14...Qxb2 would have created some confusion, although it isn't good 15.Bb3 Nc5 16.Nxf6+ Nxb3 17.Qh5+! g6 18.Qd5+ Kxf6 19.Bg5+ Kg7 20.Ne8# would be a pretty finish.] 15.Bb3 [Not an attempt to be flashy, I just didn't notice the mundane 15.Bxd7 Bxd7 16.Nxf6 collects material.] 15...Ra7 [I had seen that 15...Nc5 16.Bd2! traps Black's queen.] 16.Nxf6+ Kxf6 17.Ne8+ [There were better options like 17.Qg4 or; 
17.Nd5+ Kf7 18.Qh5+ g6 19.Nc7+ but I thought this forced mate.] 17...Ke7 [I hadn't noticed the king can retreat 17...Kg6 18.Qg4+ mates next move, or; 
17...Kf5 18.Qh5+ Kxf4 19.g3+ Ke4 20.Qg4+ Ke5 21.Qf4#] 18.Nd6! This move got me back on track - a strong simple option saving the knight, and threatening to take on c8 and a7 and also introducing the strong threat of Qe2+. 18...Qb4 [18...Ra8 19.Qe2+ Ne5 20.Bxe5 prepares a discovered check; 
18...Kd8 19.Nf7+ Ke8 20.Qe2+ Be7 21.Re1 is crushing.] 19.Nxc8+ [Short of time I saw a winning line and played it instantly 19.Qe2+ was cleaner: 19...Kd8 20.Qe8+ Kc7 21.Qxc8+ Kb6 22.Nc4++-] 19...Kd8 20.Bd2! [20.Nxa7 Qxf4 is not so simple.] 20...Qd4 21.Nxa7 [I was happy to grab the rook, and go ahead on material, but 21.Bg5+ or; 
21.Ba5+ would have collected a queen instead.] 21...Qxa7 [21...Bc5!? was worth a try, the best 22.Ba5+! with the idea of 22...b6 23.Nc6+ is not obvious.] 22.Be6 b5 23.Be3 Qc7 24.Qd5 [24.Bb6! finishes immediately, but precision is no longer necessary.] 24...Bd6 25.Rd1 My last piece joins the attack. 25...Ke7 [25...Bxh2+ 26.Kh1+-] 26.Bxd7 Qxd7 [26...Kxd7 27.Bf4+-] 27.Bg5+ 1-0

Adams,Michael (2698) - McShane,Luke J (2615) [C95]
London Classic London (7), 15.12.2009
[Adams,Michael]

It has been good to see Luke in more regular chess action recently this was our first game since 2003.
 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 d6 8.c3 0-0 9.h3 Nb8 Luke wheeled out the Breyer for the first time in the European Team Championships making an easy draw with Gashimov. I wasn't too sure what to expect but thought it could be time for a second outing.
 10.d4 Nbd7 11.Nbd2 Bb7 12.Bc2 Re8 13.Nf1 Bf8 14.Ng3 c6 This move has become quite popular and I had faced it before against Morozevich in the Spanish Team Championship in 2007. I wasn't convinced the solid but slightly passive positions arising would suit my opponent but later on he found a way to make things very interesting.
 15.a4 Qc7 16.Be3 Rad8 17.Qc1 h6 18.b3 Qb8 Black's problem here is that all his pieces are already on optimal squares and his only positive plan the d5 break opens up the game in White's favour, so he just shuffles around a bit waiting for White to commit himself.
 19.Rb1 Qc8 20.Qb2 [The aforementioned game went 20.b4 Qc7 21.Nd2 d5 when I had managed to allow Black to achieve a complete freeing of his game. Armed with the fruits of our post mortem I tried to do a bit better this time round.] 20...Qc7 21.Rbd1 Bc8 22.c4 This was the idea which got the seal of approval in the Morozevisch postmortem White secures a space advantage. 22...bxc4 [It was more flexible to take on d4 immediately as 22...exd4 23.Bxd4 c5 24.Bc3 b4 is another interesting option.] 23.bxc4 exd4 24.Bxd4 c5 25.Bc3 Bb7 I felt White should be doing well here but although I have achieved some strategical goals Black's compact structure remains a tough nut to crack.
 26.Nf5 [Luke pointed out that 26.Nh4! Re6 27.Nhf5 would have been a better way to turn the screw, preventing the dangerous counterplay that he develops in the game.] 26...Re6 27.Nd2 Rde8 [Unsurprisingly Luke wasn't interested in 27...g6 28.Ne3 Nxe4 although it is not easy to demonstrate a clearly convincing path for White I was intending (28...Bg7 is pleasant for White) 29.Nd5 (29.Bxe4 Bxe4 30.Nxe4 Rxe4 31.Nd5 Rxe1+ 32.Rxe1 Qb8 clearly gives good compensation but maybe no more than that) 29...Bxd5 30.cxd5 Nxc3 31.dxe6 Nxd1 32.exf7+ Kxf7 (32...Kh7 33.Rxd1 Bg7 looks hazardous but maybe alright) 33.Qb3+ Kg7 34.Qg3 Ne5 35.f4 which looked very promising to me although 35...Nc6 36.Qxg6+ (or 36.Re6 Kh8 37.Bxd1 Qg7 38.Rxg6 Qd4+) 36...Kh8 37.Rxd1 Qg7 continues the struggle.] 28.f3 Nh5 I hadn't appreciated the strength of this idea although the White forces are well centralised they aren't conveniently placed to cover the sensitive dark squares on the kingside that Black's knights are homing in on.
 29.Nf1 Ne5 [Taking the aggressive option although it may be objectively better to play 29...g6 30.N5e3 Bg7 when White is only a little better as the exchange of dark-squared bishops is positionally desirable for Black.] 30.N1e3 Rg6 [30...Nf4 gives Black an extra option after 31.Qc1 (but 31.Kh1 will probably transpose to the game) 31...Nxh3+] 31.Kh1 Nf4 32.Qc1 Qc8 [The queen retreat seems wise as 32...Bc8 33.Nd5 Nxd5 34.exd5; 
and 32...h5 33.Nd5 Bxd5 34.exd5 Rxg2 (34...Nxg2 35.Re2) 35.Qxf4 Rxc2 36.Bxe5 dxe5 37.Nh6+ Kh7 38.Qe4+ Kxh6 39.Qxc2 look promising for White.] 33.Ng4 Nxg2 There is no sense in going back, now things get completely crazy as both king's get exposed with large amounts of material remaining on the board.
 34.Kxg2 [I took the knight with little thought but as the horse has no retreat square there were two other options. After 34.Rg1 Black should play the amazing 34...Ne1! (34...Nxf3 35.Rxg2 Ng5 looks troublesome but 36.Rd5! is very strong the rook can't be captured as 36...Bxd5 37.exd5 is winning) 35.Rgxe1 maybe strongest a) 35.Rdxe1 Nxf3 36.Nfxh6+ gxh6 37.Nf6+ (the stronger 37.Rg3 is still very messy) 37...Kh8 leads nowhere; b) 35.Nxe5 Nxf3! (35...Rxg1+ 36.Kxg1 Nxc2 37.Nxf7 Kxf7 38.Qxc2 Re6 gives White an edge due to his more active pieces) 36.Nxg6 (36.Nxf3? is met by the devastating riposte 36...Qxf5 the queen can't be taken 37.exf5 (but after 37.Rxg6 Qxf3+ 38.Rg2 Qxh3+ 39.Kg1 Qxc3 White's position is completely wrecked.) 37...Bxf3+ 38.Rg2 Rxg2 39.Qf4 Bc6 40.Rd5 Bxd5 41.cxd5 Rxc2) 36...Nxg1 37.Nge7+ Rxe7 38.Kxg1 Rxe4 39.Nxh6+ gxh6 40.Bxe4 Bxe4 41.Qf4 is roughly equal; 35...Nxf3 36.Re3 Ng5 37.Nfxh6+ gxh6 38.Nf6+ Rxf6 39.Bxf6 looks a little better for White.; 
Therefore the other less obvious rook move might be better 34.Re2 Ne1! surprisingly still the best move even though the idea of setting up a rook fork no longer exists (34...Nxf3 35.Rxg2 reaches the position White is aiming for) 35.Rdxe1 Nxf3 36.Rf1 Ng5 37.Qf4 Qe6 looks promising for White but it's not clear how to continue if 38.Nfxh6+ gxh6 39.Nf6+ Rxf6 40.Qxf6 Qxf6 41.Bxf6 Nxe4 liquidates to an equal ending.] 34...h5 [During the game 34...Nxf3 35.Kxf3 Qxf5+ 36.Qf4 Qe6 didn't really feature in my thoughts, but it could well be a very decent practical option. It wouldn't be easy to keep White's position together in the time pressured moves before move 40.] 35.Kf2 [I didn't like the look of 35.Qf4 Qe6 and played a more ambitious move forcing Luke to open the h-file or throw more fuel on the fire.] 35...Nxf3 [White looks a little better after 35...hxg4 36.hxg4 Qe6 37.Bxe5 Qxe5 38.Rh1 Bc8] 36.Nfh6+ [The knight check is necessary as 36.Kxf3?? Qxf5+ wins for Black.] 36...Kh7 [I thought this was forced but matters are also not simple in the line 36...gxh6 37.Nf6+ Rxf6 38.Bxf6 Ne5! (38...Nxe1? 39.Rxe1 is winning for White) 39.Qf4! (39.Rg1+ Ng6 40.Qf4 Bg7 41.Qxd6) 39...Ng6 (39...Qxh3 40.Rg1+) 40.Qf5 although White should be better here.] 37.Kxf3 My king continues to meander round the board. It is interesting to note that Black's ligh-squared bishop which was biting on granite has become a very influential piece. 37...f5? Luke finds it hard to resist maximising confusion before the time control but the more straightforward. [37...hxg4+ 38.Nxg4 f5 was a better idea 39.Kg3 Qc6 (39...fxg4 40.e5) 40.Rd5 fxg4 41.hxg4 Kg8 42.Rh5 leaves White's monarch looking marginally less endangered.; 
Taking the other knight is not so clever 37...gxh6 38.Nf6+ Rxf6+ 39.Bxf6 Qxh3+ 40.Kf2 and my king walks away from the checks to victory.] 38.Kg3 fxg4 [It is hard to say if this is a mistake objectively but it clearly is in practical terms especially as after 38...hxg4 my intended 39.exf5 a) 39.Nxg4 would transpose to the variation in the last note; b) However the computer points out the strongest move 39.Nf7! and the knight emerges unscathed to keep a material edge 39...gxh3+ 40.Ng5+ Kg8 41.exf5 White should be winning here but the following variations would be very hard to find over the board. 41...Qc6 42.Rd5 Rxe1 and here (42...Rh6 43.f6) 43.Qxe1 is a rather nice touch (43.Bxe1 Rh6 44.Nxh3 Qe8 45.Bd2 is also good but less deadly) 43...Rxg5+ 44.Kh4 Rg2 45.Qe6+ Kh8 46.f6 and Black's king has limited life expectancy.; 39...Rxh6 40.hxg4 (40.f6+ g6 41.hxg4 Bf3) 40...Kg8 is not all that clear.] 39.e5 Now all my pieces are working well and although the White king still feels very uncomfortable Black doesn't have time to exploit this, partly because his own monarch is not ideally located either. 39...h4+ [I thought this was a mistake but in fact things are already over anyway if 39...dxe5 40.Rxe5 Rxe5 41.Bxe5 Qc6 42.Bxg6+ Qxg6 43.hxg4 leaves White with extra material.; 
The knight can't be captured as 39...gxh6 40.Bxg6+ (or 40.Qb1) 40...Kxg6 41.Qb1+ Qf5 42.Qxb7 win.] 40.Kxh4 [The over cautious 40.Kh2?? would lead to complete catastrophe: 40...g3+ 41.Kg1 Qxh3 but there is no reason not to capture the pawn.] 40...Be7+ 41.Kg3 [Having made the time control I felt that both king moves were winning, but decided for the sake of my blood pressure to take the safe option. Despite its precarious nature 41.Kh5 Qe6 42.Qb1 is also more than good enough.] 41...Rf8 [I was anticipating 41...gxh3+ when there are a bewildering array of promising options. 42.Bxg6+ (Luke thought 42.Kh2 was simplest but 42...gxh6 wasn't that clear to me although there is more than one way to win the computer's 43.Qb1 Reg8 44.Bxg6+ Rxg6 45.Rxd6 Bxd6 46.exd6 leaves Black's pieces pleasingly dominated) 42...Kxg6 43.e6 Bg5 44.Qb1+ Kxh6 45.Qf5 was my intention which I felt had to be winning as although I have given back all the material I am closing in on Black's king, xg7+ is one threat. One nice finish is 45...Qd8 46.Qxh3+ Kg6 47.Kg4 and White's king concludes the attack.] 42.Rf1 gxh6 [It was still a better practical chance to play 42...gxh3+ 43.Bxg6+ Kxg6 44.Ng4 (however I was intending 44.Nf7 Kh5 when either the simple (44...Rxf7 45.Qb1+ Rf5 46.exd6 is a simple win) 45.Qf4 (or the flashy 45.Rd4 Rxf7 46.Qd1+ Kg6 47.Rg4+ get the job done.) ) 44...Kh5 which could get confusing over the board.] 43.Qb1 The position has clarified and it's clear Black is out of ammunition. 43...h5 [After 43...Qe6 44.Rxf8 all Black's pieces drop off with check .] 44.Bxg6+ Kh6 45.Bxh5 Rg8 46.Bd2+ and Luke resigned as it is mate in 4. 1-0

[Adams,Michael]

This pairing seemed utterly senseless as both teams had been defeated the previous day and were the highest seeded on this score group. It is sadly all too typical of the systems used in European events that we received a double colour so it could occur. It is a fairly well established pattern that when we play against Russia 2 points is the maximum possible score, so I guess things went quite well but at one stage things looked more hopeful.
 1.c4 I prepared for several different moves to begin the game, but this one eluded me entirely. 1...e5 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.Nf3 Nc6 4.g3 Bb4 5.Nd5 Bc5 6.Bg2 d6 7.0-0 0-0 8.e3 [The immediate 8.d3 is slightly more common here.] 8...a6 9.d3 Ba7 10.Nxf6+ Although White gained a tempo with d5 in the opening, this additional move has some drawbacks, in fact two White players chose to return the knight to c3 here. [The reason is that 10.Bd2 Nxd5 11.cxd5 Ne7 should be fine for Black.] 10...Qxf6 11.Bd2 Qg6 12.Bc3 [After 12.Nh4 Qxd3 13.Rc1 h6 is good enough.] 12...Qh5 13.Nh4 [If my bishop settles on g4 things get rather awkward, and after 13.Qb3 Bg4 14.Nd2 Rab8 15.Bxc6 bxc6 16.Qa4 Black has a number of options 16...Bd7 is the simplest solution.] 13...Bg4 14.Bf3 f5 [Originally I was intending 14...Bxf3 15.Qxf3 Qxf3 16.Nxf3 f6 which must be equal but White has more pleasant play as one day he might seriously sideline my bishop.] 15.Bxg4 Qxg4 16.Qf3 [If 16.Qxg4 fxg4 White's knight on h4 finds it very hard to re-enter the game. I also have a possible plan to play d8-g5.; 
I was expecting instead 16.Kg2 which looks more natural to me.] 16...Rae8 [I wasn't too sure what to do here and made a vague move 16...Rf7 keeping the option to double on the f-line was better.] 17.Rad1 Rf7 18.b4 [The computer prefers 18.Qd5 but this looks pretty doubtful.] 18...h5 [I was tempted by the logical 18...e4 here and this was a better option, after 19.Qxg4 (19.dxe4 Rxe4 20.b5 Nd8) 19...fxg4 20.d4 Ne7 21.d5 I abandoned the line but with 21...g5 22.Ng2 b5 Black is doing well. The game move is a bit ugly but forces open lines on the kingside and things become very sharp.] 19.Qg2 f4 20.h3 Qd7 21.gxf4 [With some justification, I was worried about the line 21.b5 axb5 22.cxb5 Ne7 (The radical 22...fxe3 23.bxc6 exf2+ 24.Kh2 Qxc6 25.Qxc6 bxc6 is hard to assess) 23.gxf4 exf4 24.e4 when White's king is safe and mine will soon feel uncomfortable.] 21...exf4 22.Kh2 [Now 22.b5 makes no sense as my knight has another square available: 22...axb5 23.cxb5 Ne5] 22...fxe3 23.fxe3 Ref8 [The computer claims 23...Bxe3 is playable but during the game both 24.Rxf7 (and 24.Nf5) 24...Qxf7 25.Rf1 Bf4+ 26.Kh1 looked terrifying.] 24.d4 The pawn advance blocks my bishop but also impedes my opponent's, and if the pawn advances again both bishops get a new lease of life. [24.Bxg7 Rxg7 25.Qd5+ Rff7 26.Nf5 would be scary at the board but Black has at least 26...Rg6 27.Nh4 Rgg7 28.Nf5 with a repetition.; 
The computer mentions the sneaky 24.Qd5 Ne7 25.Qg5 Nf5 26.Ng6 Nxe3 27.Nxf8 Nxf1+ 28.Rxf1 Rxf8 would lead to a draw. This was a wiser option as the impressive line of pawns on the fourth rank prove to be built on a foundation of sand.] 24...Ne7 25.e4 [White is wise to decline the pawn 25.Rxf7 Rxf7 26.Qxb7 Qe6 27.Qxa7 (or 27.Ng2 Qxc4) 27...Qxe3 leaves White's pieces in chaos.] 25...Qa4 [Not a bad move but the simple 25...Qe6 26.d5 Qh6 was good.] 26.Rxf7 Rxf7 27.Rd3 [The computer recommends 27.Qe2 I assumed 27...Rf2+ 28.Qxf2 Qxd1 would be promising but 29.c5 holds thing together.; 
After 27.Rg1 a5 it is very hard to find a move for White.] 27...a5 Now White's position falls apart.
 28.Nf3 [28.a3 Qxa3 29.bxa5 Bxd4 wins,; 
and 28.bxa5 Qxc4 also looks grim.] 28...axb4 29.Be1 Qc6 30.Ng5 Qxc4 31.Qe2? [After 31.Rb3! White keeps the material disadvantage to manageable proportions and is still fighting.] 31...Ng6 [The attacking chances are also illusory after 31...Rf6 32.e5 dxe5 33.dxe5 Rf8 as now 34.Qxh5 is impossible as 34...Qxd3 covers h7 but my more forcing knight move should have been even more efficient.] 32.Nxf7 Nf4 33.Nh6+ Kh7 34.Qf3 Qxd3 [Finding a way not to win here was not easy but I proved more than up to the task 34...Nxd3 looks risky but 35.Qf5+ g6 36.Qd7+ Kxh6 37.Bd2+ g5 leaves White with nothing e.g 38.h4 Bxd4 39.Bxg5+ Kg6 40.Qf5+ Kg7 41.Qd7+ Qf7] 35.Qxf4 Qxd4? [I had calculated this won some time ago and stuck with my original intention, but missing the line 35...Qe2+ 36.Bf2 (36.Qf2 Qxf2+ 37.Bxf2 Kxh6 is straightforward) 36...Bxd4 is pretty awful.; 
35...Bxd4 as my opponent indicated after the game is equally decisive, both ...e2+ and ...e5 are threatened.] 36.Qg5 Qxe4 [I thought 36...gxh6 enabled my king to escape from the checks by the queen but only realised at this stage that bishop checks were also possible when my king goes to a dark square. 37.Qf5+ (37.Qe7+ Qg7 wins) 37...Kg7 38.Qd7+ and perpetual check is inevitable.] 37.Qf5+ Qxf5 38.Nxf5 Bc5 39.Kg3 g5 [I could still keep some advantage with 39...d5 now White regains a pawn and the game peters out.] 40.Bd2 Kg6 41.Ne7+ Kf6 42.Nd5+ Ke5 43.Nxc7 g4 44.hxg4 [Given the flow of the game I was happy to see this liquidation, 44.h4 was more enterprising but should also lead to a draw; one possible line goes 44...Ke4 45.Ne8 Kd3 46.Bg5 Kc2 47.Nf6 Kb2 48.Nxh5 Kxa2 49.Nf4 b3 50.Nd3 b2 51.Nxb2 Kxb2] 44...hxg4 45.Kxg4 Ke4 46.Kg5 Kd3 [46...d5 was a better try but wouldn't change the result.] 47.Be1 Kc2 48.Nd5 Kb2 ½-½

Biel 53rd Biel (6), 28.07.2020
[Adams,Michael]

This was actually our sixth over the board game of the year, which is quite a lot in 2020. Our first, which was drawn, in Gibraltar took place in a very different world. In our earlier encounters in Biel, I thought I was doing well in a Fischer Random game, attacking my opponent's king, which I happily thought was stuck in the centre. He then unexpectedly castled to safety, incidentally threatening mate in one, which was a decidely unpleasant surprise, how I won that game remains something of a mystery. I managed to score more convincingly in the Rapid, although my share of the points in the blitz was pretty fortuitous. Dies war tatsächlich unsere sechste Am-Brett-Partie des Jahres, was 2020 eine ganze Menge ist. Unsere erste in Gibraltar, die Remis ausging, fand in einer ganz anderen Welt statt. In unseren vorherigen Begegnungen in Biel meinte ich in einer Fischer-Random-Partie, den gegnerischen König angreifend, welchen ich fröhlich im Zentrum festzuhalten glaubte, gut zu stehen. Dann rochierte er unversehens in Sicherheit, nebenbei mit einzügiger Mattdrohung, was eine ausgesprochen unangenehme Überraschung war; wie ich diese Partie gewann, bleibt ein gewisses Mysterium. Überzeugender vermochte ich im Rapid zu punkten, wenngleich meine Ausbeute im Blitz ziemlich glücklich war. 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 d5 4.Nc3 [My opponent is something of an expert after Mein Gegner ist eine Art Experte nach 4.g3 as occurred in our Blitz game with the same colours, and I hadn't really considered him entering the QGD instead. He proved very well informed here too, however. , wie in unserer Blitzpartie mit den gleichen Farben geschehen, und ich hatte nicht wirklich erwogen, dass er stattdessen ins Angenommene Damengambit geht. Er erwies sich allerdings auch hier als ziemlich gut informiert.] 4...Be7 5.Bf4 0-0 6.e3 Nbd7 7.c5 c6 After a bad loss the previous day, I settled for a solid line where I have some experience. Nach einer bösen Schlappe am Vortag wählte ich eine solide Variante, in der ich einige Erfahrung habe. 8.h3 b6 9.b4 a5 10.a3 h6 11.Qc1 Bb7 12.Be2 Qc8 13.0-0 Ba6 14.Qc2 Bxe2 [I had previously played Zuvor hatte ich 14...Qb7 15.Rfc1 in a game with Ding Liren. gespielt, in einer Partie mit Ding Liren.] 15.Qxe2 Qb7 16.Rfb1 Noel chooses another square for the rook opposite my queen, facilitating b5 ideas. Noel wählt ein anderes Feld für den Turm gebenüber meiner Dame, was b5-Ideen erleichtert. 16...Ra7!? [It's too early to release the tension: Es ist zu früh, die Spannung aufzuheben: 16...axb4?! 17.axb4 Rxa1? 18.Rxa1 Ra8 19.Rxa8+ Qxa8 20.Qa2 Qb7 (20...Qxa2? 21.Nxa2 b5 22.Nd2!+-) 21.Qa4 leaves the c6 pawn very vulnerable. macht den c6-Bauern sehr anfällig.; 
The thematic Das thematische 16...Rfc8!? was worth considering. kam in Betracht.] 17.Qc2 [It seems more natural to transfer the knight to the queenside immediately, but this move is necessary as Natürlicher wirkt es, den Springer sofort zum Damenflügel zu transferieren, aber dieser Zug ist nötig, da 17.Nd2? axb4 18.axb4 Rxa1 19.Rxa1 bxc5 20.bxc5 Qb2 is rather embarrassing. My opponent's moves were coming sufficiently quickly, that I suspected he was still within preparation. ziemlich peinlich ist. Die Züge meines Gegners kamen hinreichend schnell, so dass ich vermutete, er noch innerhalb der Vorbereitung war.] 17...axb4 [17...Rc8!? was interesting, after war interessant, nach 18.Nd2 the surprising ist das überraschende 18...Rca8! taking the delayed route to a8 is now good as , was die verzögerte Route nach a8 einschlägt, nunmehr gut, da 19.b5? now no longer works, as White's knight can't come to e5. nicht länger funktioniert, da der weiße Springer nicht nach a5 kommen kann. 19...bxc5;

Ein ungewöhnliches Vorkommnis bei dieser Bauernstruktur! 28.Nb3! Ndxc5! 29.Na5! Nb4 30.Nxd5! The knight interplay succeeds in limiting the damage.

[From both a practical and objective point of view, it was wise to try and impede my plan, as now the play becomes very one-sided. I had mainly analysed Sowohl in praktischer als auch objektiver Hinsicht war es klug zu versuchen, meinen Plan zu verhindern, denn nun wird das Spiel sehr einseitig. In meiner Vorbereitung hatte ich vor allem 8...Nd4! 9.Nxd4 cxd4 10.c4 in my preparation. After the knight moves away White will have a very comfortable Benoni but it's unclear if this is enough for an advantage. analysiert.

Gibraltar Masters 16th Caleta (10), 01.02.2018
[Adams,Michael]

Gibraltar is an unusual event because there are 10 consecutive playing days, and I was fortunate that the fatigue affected my adversaries in the final 2 games. 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.Bb5+ Bd7 [I thought my opponent would play 3...Nd7 here.] 4.Bxd7+ Nxd7 5.0-0 Ngf6 6.Re1 e6 [After 6...g6 7.c3 White can build a strong centre.] 7.d4 cxd4 8.Nxd4 Be7 [8...Rc8!? is an interesting option here.] 9.c4 0-0 10.b3 [During the game I thought this was more accurate to prevent d5 ideas, but the straightforward 10.Nc3!? was also reasonable 10...Rc8 11.b3 d5 is a critical line 12.exd5 exd5 13.Nxd5 Nxd5 14.cxd5 Nb6! (I was looking at 14...Bf6?! 15.Rb1 but here Black is struggling.) 15.Nf5 Bf6 16.Ba3 Qxd5 17.Qxd5 Nxd5 18.Bxf8 Bxa1 19.Ba3 Bf6 20.Nd6 Ra8 21.Nxb7 Nc3 Black should hold, but it's not much fun.] 10...Re8 [I was expecting a transfer to a traditional Hedgehog with 10...a6 although this is not a very fashionable option these days. I'm sure Ulf Andersson would be happy here with Black!; 
Nils spent some time here, and was obviously considering 10...d5!? which isn't a bad option 11.e5 Ne4 12.cxd5 exd5 13.f3 Bb4 (13...Ng5!?) 14.fxe4 Bxe1 15.Qxe1 Nxe5 when matters are rather murky.] 11.Bb2 Nc5 [Again the central break is hard to assess 11...d5!? 12.e5 Ne4 13.cxd5 (13.f3 Nec5 14.cxd5 exd5) 13...exd5 14.e6 looks dangerous here, but due to White's lagging development it is too ambitious 14...fxe6 15.Nxe6 Qb6 (15...Qa5!? is another good option) 16.Rxe4 dxe4 17.Qxd7 e3 18.Qd5? which I thought was good enough, but as my opponent pointed out after the game (18.Na3! exf2+ 19.Kf1 Qd6 20.Qxd6 Bxd6 21.Ng5 Bxh2 is roughly equal.) 18...exf2+ 19.Kf1 Qa6+! leaves Black in charge. 20.Kxf2? Bh4+-+] 12.Nc3 d5? [Having rejected two viable occasions to make this move, this is a really unfortunate moment for this break - it simply loses immediately. 12...a6 or; 
12...Rc8 were indicated.] 13.exd5 exd5 14.Nf5! Bf8 [14...Qd7 15.Nxg7! Kxg7 16.Nxd5+- is totally crushing.; 
14...d4 15.Rxe7 Rxe7 16.Nxe7+ Qxe7 17.Qxd4 is relatively best, but far from hopeful.; 
My opponent had not initially realised that 14...dxc4? 15.Nxe7+ Rxe7 16.Qxd8+ wins a rook.] 15.Rxe8 Qxe8 16.Nxd5 Nxd5 17.Nh6+! [A killing intermezzo 17.cxd5?! Qe4 allows Black to fight] 17...Kh8 [17...gxh6 18.Qg4+ mates.] 18.Qxd5 Qe6 [Black has to part with a second pawn: 18...f6 19.Qg8# is an abrupt conclusion; 
18...Ne6 19.Re1! and Black lacks a decent move: 19...Rd8? 20.Qxd8! Qxd8 21.Nxf7++-] 19.Nxf7+ Kg8 20.Qxe6 Nxe6 21.Ne5 Rd8 [21...a5!? was probably the best way to try to cause trouble.] 22.Bc3 Black has no entry squares, and conversion was not too difficult. 22...Bc5 23.Kf1 Bd4 24.Bxd4 Rxd4 25.Re1! Nc5 [25...Rd2 is repelled by 26.Nf3 .] 26.Nf3 Rd6 27.Ng5 Now the exchange of knights is pretty inevitable. 27...Rd8 28.g3 h6 29.Ne6 Nxe6 30.Rxe6 Kf7 31.Re5 Rd2 32.a4 [I was thinking for a while about 32.Rc5 Rxa2 33.Rc7+ Kf6 34.Rxb7 a5 but the game move is cleaner.] 32...Rb2 33.Rb5 b6 34.h4 Ke6 [34...g6 was more practical, once the pawn is fixed on g7 the game is over.] 35.h5 Kd6 36.a5 Kc6 37.axb6 axb6 38.Kg2 With my king heading up the board and no targets to aim at Black resigned. A nice way to finish the tournament, as I joined the winning group of players on 7.5/10. 1-0

14.Kg2 This novelty is quite clever as the king is ready to cover the g-pawn but avoids possible bishop checks on the light squares. White's positional assets looked rather daunting over the board but his king will not feel comfortable for some time.] 14...b6 [The pawn is safe for now as 14...hxg4 15.hxg4 Rh2+ 16.Kg3 Rxc2 17.Nh7 wins material. My move improving Black's king position seems logical.] 15.f5 Kb7 16.Nc3 [If White can complete development without incident his advanced pawns will be a crucial asset 16.c4 was the alternative.] 16...hxg4 [Accepting the challenge as 16...Nd5 17.Nxd5 cxd5 18.Kg3 looks pleasant for White.] 17.hxg4 Rh2+ 18.Kg3 Rxc2 19.Nh7 My bishop is destined to perish on its starting square but my other pieces become very active.

22.Kh3 gxf6 23.Bh6 f5 24.g5 f4 is also bad.] 22...gxf6 23.exf6 Rf2+ 24.Ke3 [24.Ke5 Re8 forces mate in 2; 
24.Kg5 Rxf8 25.fxe7 Rg8+ 26.Kh4 Rg2 only lasts a little longer.] 24...Rxf6 25.Nh7 Rf3+ 26.Kd2 [The alternative 26.Ke2 Rh8 27.Ng5 Rh2+ 28.Ke1 Rff2 29.Be3 (29.Rd2 Rxd2 30.Bxd2 Rh1+) 29...Rfg2 is no better.] 26...Rd8+ 27.Kc2 [Or 27.Ke1 Rh8 28.Ng5 Rh1+ 29.Kd2 Rh2+] 27...Rxc3+ 28.bxc3 Ba4+ 29.Kb2 Rxd1 With 2 extra pawns and the better position the rest is simple.

After a lot of build up everyone was eager for the match to start, and this fighting game bodes well for the spectators. Nach langem Vorlauf warteten alle gespannt auf den Beginn des Matches, und diese Kampfpartie lässt die Zuschauer Gutes erhoffen. 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 0-0 8.h3 Na5 [I was glad to see an opening that I have some experience with, but I was not at all aware of this rather rare move.

Wie viele wertvolle neue Konzepte scheint er im Nachhinein nicht so überraschend zu sein. Ein weitere wichtige Fortsetzung, die in der WM-Partie Karjakin-Carlsen diskutiert wurde, verläuft 8...Bb7 9.d3 d5 10.exd5 Nxd5 11.Nxe5 Nd4 when Black will acquire the bishop pair and a lead in development to compensate for the pawn. In the game events develop in similar fashion. , wonach Schwarz als Kompensation für den Bauern das Läuferpaar und einen Entwicklungsvorsprung erhält. In der Partie entwickeln sich die Ereignisse auf ähnliche Weise.] 9.Nxe5 Nxb3 [9...d6? 10.Nf3 c5 11.d3 doesn't give enough. gibt nicht genug.] 10.axb3 Bb7 11.d3 d5 The forcing play continues. Das forcierte Spiel geht weiter. 12.exd5 Qxd5 [It's tempting to try Es ist verlockend, 12...Nxd5 but zu versuchen, aber 13.d4! is a good response, the knight might drop back to d3 whilst his colleague goes to f3 to consolidate matters. ist eine gute Antwort, der Springer könnte sich nach d3 zurückziehen, während sein Kollege nach f3 geht, um die Lage zu konsolidieren.] 13.Qf3 [13.Nf3 Rae8 gives Black plenty of compensation, swapping queens is clearly preferable. gibt Schwarz viel Kompensation, ein Damentausch ist eindeutig vorzuziehen.] 13...Bd6 14.Kf1 [A subtle finesse. Not Eine subtile Finesse. Nicht 14.Nc3? Qxe5 15.Rxe5 Bxf3-+; 
14.Qxd5 Nxd5 15.Bd2 gives Black a better version of the game. gibt Schwarz eine bessere Version der Partie.] 14...Rfb8 The players were rather substantially better informed than me, as Nepo confirmed at the press conference that this position was also in his preparation, whilst Carlsen was still playing quickly. Die Spieler waren wesentlich besser informiert als ich, denn Nepo bestätigte auf der Pressekonferenz, dass diese Stellung auch in seiner Vorbereitung war, während Carlsen immer noch schnell spielte. [14...Rfe8? 15.Nc3! Qxe5 16.Rxe5 Bxf3 17.Rxe8+ is exactly what White wants. ist genau das, was Weiß will.; 
For those of you who that were hoping the queens would have stayed on the board a bit longer I can recommend investigating the very interesting, Denjenigen, die gehofft haben, dass die Damen noch etwas länger auf dem Brett bleiben, kann ich empfehlen, das sehr interessante 14...Qxe5!? here are some preliminary lines: zu untersuchen. Hier sind einige vorläufige Varianten: 15.Qxb7 Qh2 the black queen can't be evicted, and although there aren't immediate threats matters are quite complicated Die schwarze Dame kann nicht vertrieben werden, und obwohl es keine unmittelbaren  Drohungen gibt, ist die Lage ziemlich kompliziert 16.Nc3 A real computer move Ein echter Computerzug a) 16.Be3 c6! 17.Qxc6 Rac8 18.Qf3 Rxc2 is ok for Black. ist für Schwarz in Ordnung.; b) 16.Qf3 Rae8 17.Be3 Nh5! a great move clearing a path for the f-pawn ein großartiger Zug, der den Weg für den f-Bauern freimacht 18.Qxh5 f5 19.f4! Bxf4 20.Qf3 Bxe3 (20...Qh1+ 21.Kf2 Qxe1+ 22.Kxe1 Rxe3+ 23.Qxe3 Bxe3 24.Rxa6) 21.Rxe3 Qh1+ (21...f4 looks rather scary sieht ziemlich gruselig aus 22.Re4! Rxe4 23.Qxe4 (23.dxe4 Rd8!) 23...f3 24.gxf3 Qxc2 25.Qe6+ Kh8 26.Qe2 Qc1+ 27.Kg2 Black is worse here. Hier steht Schwarz schlechter.) 22.Kf2 f4 23.Re4 Qc1 24.Ke2 Qxb2 25.Rxa6 Qxb1 26.Kd2 The material is regained but White's king has now found a safe home in the middle. Das Material wird zurückgewonnen, aber der weiße König hat nun ein sicheres Zuhause in der Mitte gefunden.; 16...Rfe8 (16...Rae8 17.Be3 b4 18.Ne2 Qh1+ 19.Ng1 Bh2 (19...Nh5 20.Qf3 Bh2 21.Ke2 Nf4+ 22.Kd2) 20.Ke2) 17.Be3 c6 18.Qxc6 Rac8 19.Qf3 b4 20.Ne2 Rxc2 21.g4 Rxb2 22.Bd4 with a wild position where White is apparently doing well. mit einer wilden Stellung, in der Weiß offenbar gut steht.] 15.Qxd5 Nxd5 16.Bd2 [White wants to keep the square c3 for his pieces, and Weiß will das Feld c3 für seine Figuren behalten, und 16.c3 c5 also makes the pawn on d3 vulnerable. macht auch den Bauern auf d3 verwundbar.; 
16.Nc3? Nb4] 16...c5 Black will rely on the greater space, activity and the long term potential of the bishops to maintain the balance. Schwarz wird sich auf den größeren Raum, die Aktivität und das langfristige Potenzial der Läufer verlassen, um das Gleichgewicht zu halten. 17.Nf3 [More subtle than Subtiler als 17.Nc3 Nb4 18.Rac1 Rd8 I thought stacking the knights on e3 and e2 could be good here Ich dachte, die Springer auf e3 und e2 zu stapeln, könnte hier gut sein. 19.Ng4 h5 20.Ne3 Bf8! 21.Ne2 g6! is a sound response, the bishop can profitably emerge on g7 or h6. ist eine gute Antwort, der Läufer kann profitabel auf g7 oder h6 auftauchen.] 17...Rd8 [17...Nb4!? 18.Bxb4 (18.Rc1 is similar to the game ist ähnlich wie die Partie) 18...cxb4 I once had a game with David Howell with this structure, although queens remained on the board in that game. One oddity of this pawn formation is that despite the preponderance of White pawns on the queenside, the fact that Black's pawns are all towards the edge of the board means that creating a passed a-pawn is a real possibility in the long term. Ich hatte einmal eine Partie mit David Howell mit dieser Struktur, obwohl in dieser Partie die Damen auf dem Brett blieben. Eine Besonderheit dieser Bauernformation ist, dass trotz der numerischen Überlegenheit der weißen Bauern am Damenflügel die schwarzen Bauern alle am Brettrand stehen, was bedeutet, dass die Schaffung eines a-Freibauern auf lange Sicht eine echte Möglichkeit ist. 19.c4 (19.Nbd2 Rc8!) 19...Bxf3 20.gxf3 Bf4] 18.Nc3 Nb4 19.Rec1 An interesting decision the other rook can be useful on the a-file sometimes, and as all the entry squares on the e-file are well protected, it isn't so influential there. The position is quite tense and not that easy to play, often releasing the tension is a mistake. The next few moves see both players move the same minor piece on consecutive moves as White tries to untangle. Eine interessante Entscheidung, der andere Turm kann manchmal auf der a-Linie nützlich sein, und da alle Einbruchsfelder auf der e-Linie gut geschützt sind, ist er dort nicht so einflussreich. Die Stellung ist ziemlich spannungsvoll und nicht ganz einfach zu spielen, oft ist es ein Fehler, die Spannung zu lösen. In den nächsten Zügen ziehen beide Spieler mehrmals nacheinander dieselbe Leichtfigur, während Weiß versucht, sich zu entwirren. 19...Rac8 [I hope that one day I can impose c4, Ich hoffe, dass ich eines Tages c4 durchsetzen kann, 19...f6 20.Ne2 Kf7 looked like a good alternative sah wie eine gute Alternative aus] 20.Ne2 [The constraint Das forcierende 20.Ne4 Bf8 is less impressive ist weniger beeindruckend 21.Bxb4 (21.Ng3 Bxf3 22.gxf3 g6!) 21...cxb4 22.Ne1 g6 and Black will fianchetto another bishop to great effect. und Schwarz wird einen weiteren Läufer mit großer Wirkung fianchettieren.] 20...Nc6 [A surprising retreat when Ein überraschender Rückzug, zumal 20...Bf8 21.Bxb4 (The cautious Das vorsichtige 21.Ne1!? or oder; 21.Bc3!? are more challenging. sind eine größere Herausforderung.) 21...cxb4 22.d4 g6 23.c3 Bh6 24.Rd1 Bd5 is ok for Black ok für Schwarz ist.; 
20...f6!? still seems sensible scheint immer noch sinnvoll] 21.Be3 [White would like to push d4 here, all his pieces are set for this advance, and this further reinforces that idea. However, I think Weiß möchte hier d4 durchdrücken, alle seine Figuren sind für diesen Vorstoß bereit, und dies verstärkt diese Idee noch. Ich denke jedoch 21.Bf4! made sense here, Black's pieces are a bit disorganised for the moment. ergab hier Sinn, denn die Figuren von Schwarz sind im Moment etwas unorganisiert. 21...Bf8 (21...Be7 22.Bg5! f6 23.Be3 Nb4 24.d4) 22.Rd1 Ne7 23.d4] 21...Ne7! [Another knight move, but a good decision, since he will find another good position on f5. Ein weiterer Springerzug, aber eine gute Entscheidung, da er eine weitere gute Stellung auf f5 finden wird. 21...Nb4?! 22.d4!] 22.Bf4?! [At a critical moment Ian forces an bishop exchange, which is not good, more patient play was more practical and precise. In einem kritischen Moment erzwingt Ian einen Läufertausch, was nicht gut ist, geduldigeres Spiel war praktischer und präziser. 22.Rd1 Nf5 23.Bd2 f6 isn't that impressive. ist nicht besonders beeindruckend.; 
I like Mir gefällt 22.Ng3! the most after am meisten, nach 22...Nd5 Black's play doesn't make a convincing impression, having taken three moves to transfer the knight to d5 from b4. All those jumps had their points, and interfered with White's plans, but macht das Spiel von Schwarz keinen überzeugenden Eindruck, da er drei Züge brauchte, um den Springer von b4 nach d5 zu bringen. Alle diese Sprünge hatten ihre Berechtigung und durchkreuzten die Pläne von Weiß, aber (22...f5 23.Re1!) 23.Bd2 is the kind of position White should aim for. ist die Art von Stellung, die Weiß anstreben sollte.; 
22.Nc3!? Nf5 23.Ne4 White's knight has taken the scenic route to e4. Der weiße Springer hat die Aussichtsroute nach e4 genommen. 23...Be7 24.Bd2 (24.Bf4 c4!) 24...f6 (24...c4 25.bxc4 bxc4 26.Ba5) ; 
The direct Die direkte 22.d4 Nf5 23.c3 or oder(23.Rd1 also have some merit. haben auch einige Vorzüge.) ] 22...Bxf3 23.gxf3 Bxf4 24.Nxf4 Rc6! The position has clarified, and this move is very strong - the pawn on a6 is secured, and now the White rook on a1 becomes peripheral to the action. Black's rook can also be active along the third rank, in particular probing White's shattered kingside pawns. Die Stellung hat sich geklärt, und dieser Zug ist sehr stark - der Bauer auf a6 ist gesichert, und nun wird der weiße Turm auf a1 zum Zuschauer des Geschehens. Der schwarze Turm kann auch auf der dritten Reihe aktiv werden und dabei insbesondere die zerschlagenen weißen Bauern am Königsflügel angehen. 25.Re1 [25.Ra5 g6 26.Rca1 Rdd6 leaves White's rooks up a blind alley. lässt die Türme von Weiß in einer Sackgasse stehen.] 25...Nf5 26.c3 The knight is kept away from d4, but now there are lots of weaklings. Der Springer wird von d4 ferngehalten, aber jetzt gibt es eine Menge Schwächlinge. 26...Nh4 27.Re3 Kf8 [A strange decision Eine seltsame Entscheidung 27...g6 gets rid of back rank issues, and Black might well regain the pawn with a much more compact position. beseitigt die Probleme der Grundreihe, und Schwarz könnte durchaus den Bauern in einer viel kompakteren Stellung zurückgewinnen. 28.Ke2 (28.Ng2? Nf5) 28...h6!? would be a little unpleasant to meet the knight on f4 is not secure, and has no flight squares. wäre ein wenig unangenehm zu spielen, der Springer auf f4 ist nicht sicher und hat keine Fluchtfelder.(28...Kf8 is a better version of the game ist eine bessere Version der Partie; 28...Rf6 29.Re4) ] 28.Ng2 [Now after Jetzt ist nach 28.Ke2 g5 or oder(28...Rf6 are good for Black. gut für Schwarz.) ] 28...Nf5 29.Re5 g6 30.Ne1 [A passive place for the knight although it does protect two of the weak pawns. Ein passiver Platz für den Springer, obwohl er zwei der schwachen Bauern schützt. 30.Ke2! leaves White's rook without many squares but it isn't easy to exploit this. lässt den weißen Turm ohne viele Felder, aber es ist nicht einfach, dies auszunutzen. 30...Ng7! looks best, but it is a much better version of the game for White. sieht am besten aus, aber es ist eine viel bessere Version der Partie für Weiß.(30...f6 31.Re4 Nd6 32.Rh4! and White's rook is not as short of room as it looks und der weiße Turm hat nicht so wenig Platz, wie es aussieht (32.Re3 Kf7! leaves White without an obvious move. lässt Weiß ohne einen offensichtlichen Zug zurück.(32...Nf5 33.Re4 repeats mit Zugwiederholung) ) 32...h5 (32...Rd7 33.Ne3) 33.b4 (33.Ne3 g5? 34.Rxh5 Kg7 35.Rg1! Kg6 36.Rh4+-) 33...g5 34.Rxh5 Kg7 35.bxc5 Kg6 36.Rh4) ] 30...Ng7 31.Re4 [31.f4!? Ne6 32.f5 Nf4 33.fxg6 hxg6 34.Re3 at least swaps one of the weak pawns. tauscht zumindest einen der schwachen Bauern.] 31...f5! [The rook should be driven to the rear Der Turm sollte nach hinten getrieben werden 31...Ne6?! 32.b4! is much more what White is looking for ist viel mehr das, wonach Weiß sucht 32...f5 a) After Nach 32...Ng5 the amusing ist das Amüsante 33.bxc5 (33.Rh4 is a simpler option. ist eine einfachere Option.) 33...Nxe4 34.fxe4 Rxc5 35.Rxa6 is fun lustig.; b) 32...cxb4 33.Rxb4 g5; 33.Rxe6 Rxe6 34.bxc5 is dangerous only for Black ist nur für Schwarz gefährlich 34...Rde8 35.d4 Re2 36.Nd3 Rd2 37.Ne5] 32.Re3 Ne6 33.Ng2 It is clear Black's knight is dominating it's adversary. Es ist klar, dass der schwarze Springer seinen Gegenüber dominiert. 33...b4! [Black could have improved the king first with Schwarz hätte den König zuerst mit 33...Kf7 but this would give White's own king more time to reinforce the queenside - playing this directly maximises the pressure. verbessern können, aber dies würde dem weißen König mehr Zeit geben, den Damenflügel zu verstärken - dies direkt zu spielen, maximiert den Druck.] 34.Ke2 A sad move to make, but as the c3 pawn must stay in place to keep d4 covered there are no other promising options. Ein trauriger Zug, aber da der c3-Bauer stehen bleiben muss, um d4 zu decken, gibt es keine anderen vielversprechenden Möglichkeiten. 34...Rb8 35.Kd2! [Return of the pledge on its terms Rückgabe des Bauern zu seinen Bedingungen. 35.Rb1? a5! 36.Kd2 bxc3+ 37.bxc3 a4 is already very serious ist bereits sehr ernst 38.Kc2? axb3+ 39.Rxb3 Nd4+-+] 35...bxc3+ 36.bxc3 Rxb3 37.Kc2 [37.Ra2 Rb1 38.Re1 Rxe1 39.Nxe1 Nf4 is also not desirable. ist ebenfalls nicht wünschenswert] 37...Rb7 [37...Rcb6? 38.Rxe6!+-] 38.h4 Kf7 [38...Nd4+ 39.Kd1 doesn't lead anywhere. führt nirgendwo hin.; 
However Magnus could use this tactical idea to play Magnus konnte diese taktische Idee jedoch dazu nutzen, 38...a5! as zu spielen, da 39.Rxa5? (39.Ree1! Rcb6 40.Ra2 a4 41.Ne3 Ra6 42.Rea1 Rba7 is no fun for White, the a-pawn is now much more useful. The direct 33...b4! was well timed, but here Carlsen was not quite urgent enough. ist kein Spaß für Weiß, der a-Bauer ist jetzt viel nützlicher. Das direkte 33...b4! war gut getimt, aber hier war Carlsen nicht zwingend genug.) 39...Nd4+ isn't possible. ist nicht möglich.; 
38...Rcb6!? was also better than the move played. war auch besser als der gespielte Zug.] 39.Ree1! Suddenly White's co-ordination has returned, and now the knight that has had a hard life recently has a route to freedom via e3 and c4.The b5 pawn's disappearance created this new potential. Plötzlich ist die weiße Koordination zurückgekehrt, und der Springer, der in letzter Zeit ein schweres Leben hatte, hat nun einen Weg in die Freiheit über e3 und c4. Das Verschwinden des b5-Bauern hat dieses neue Potenzial geschaffen. 39...Kf6 40.Ne3 [After 40.Ra2 f4 leaves the knight on g2 looking silly again. This may not be so bad, but it is not easy to allow. lässt den Springer auf g2 wieder dumm aussehen. Das mag nicht so schlimm sein, aber man lässt es nicht gerne zu.] 40...Rd7 [40...Nf4! looked rather obvious and sets a small trap sah ziemlich offensichtlich aus und stellt eine kleine Falle 41.Nc4 (41.Ra4? Rb2+! 42.Kxb2 Nxd3+-+) 41...Re7 is still not completely dead ist noch nicht ganz tot 42.Rxe7 (42.Re3!?) 42...Kxe7 43.Ra4 Ng2! and White must be more careful. und Weiß muss mehr aufpassen.] 41.Nc4 [White could even play Weiß könnte sogar 41.Ra4!? as proposed by Judit Polgar. spielen, wie von Judit Polgar vorgeschlagen. 41...Rd8 (41...h5?! 42.Nc4) 42.Rea1 Rcd6 43.Rd1 is likely to lead to the same result. The players head for a repetition instead. wird wahrscheinlich zum gleichen Ergebnis führen. Die Spieler steuern stattdessen auf eine Wiederholung zu.] 41...Re7 42.Ne5 [Even the 'oversight' Selbst das 'Verrsehen' 42.Ra4 Nd4+ 43.cxd4 Rxe1 44.d5 Rc8 45.Rxa6+ Kg7 46.Ra7+ leads to a draw. führt zu einem Unentschieden.] 42...Rd6 43.Nc4 Rc6 44.Ne5 Rd6 45.Nc4 An interesting opening encounter. Magnus edged the preparation battle, although clearly both particpants are well armed there. Carlsen got the type of position he would probably be happy to see in this match, but Ian got back on track after drifting earlier in the endgame. The Marshall also proved a tough nut to crack for Nepomniachtchi's compatriot Sergey Karjakin in their match. With no free day before game three, it will be intriguing to see if Magnus repeats his opening choice then. Eine interessante Auftaktbegegnung. Magnus gewann die Vorbereitungsschlacht, obwohl beide Teilnehmer dort eindeutig gut gerüstet sind. Carlsen bekam die Art von Stellung, die er in diesem Match wahrscheinlich gerne sehen würde, aber Ian kam, nachdem er anfangs im Endspiel abdriftete, wieder in die Spur. Marshall erwies sich auch für Nepomniachtchis Landsmann Sergey Karjakin als harte Nuss in ihrem Match . Da es vor der dritten Partie keinen freien Tag mehr gibt, wird es spannend sein zu sehen, ob Magnus seine Eröffnungswahl dann wiederholt. ½-½

1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.Bb5+ Nd7 Now the most common response this leads to much more interesting play than 3...Bd7. 4.Ba4 The latest fashion, this is quite a clever idea keeping options of c3 or c4 depending on Black's response. 4...Ngf6 5.0-0 a6 [The point is that 5...Nxe4?! 6.Re1 Nef6 7.d4 is very dangerous, so White doesn't have to defend the pawn immediately.] 6.c4 e5 [6...Nxe4?! 7.Re1 Nef6 8.d4 is still not easy, 8...e6 9.d5! e5 10.Nxe5! shows one of the attacking concepts.

1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 I had intended to play the Advance pre tournament, but before the game wasn't sure how to counter the variation that occurred in my opponent's last round game with Naiditsch. It seems Arkadij was rather better informed. Vor dem Turnier hatte ich beabsichtigt, die Vorstoßvariante zu spielen, war aber vor der Partie nicht sicher, wie ich der Variante begegnen sollte, die in der Letztrundenbegegnung meines Gegners gegen Naiditsch aufs Brett gekommen war. Offenbar war Arkadij da deutlich besser informiert.
 3.Nd2 dxe4 4.Nxe4 Bf5 5.Ng3 Bg6 6.h4 h6 7.Nf3 Nf6 I wasn't expecting this line.
 Dieses Abspiel hatte ich nicht erwartet. 8.Ne5 Bh7 9.Bd3 Nbd7 10.Bxh7 [I played 10.f4 here in my game with Mamedyarov in the London Grand Prix. an dieser Stelle hatte ich in meiner Partie gegen Mamedyarov beim London Grand Prix gespielt.] 10...Nxe5 11.dxe5 Qa5+ 12.Kf1 Nxh7 13.e6 Qd5 This looks very logical aiming to remove the e6 pawn as quickly as possible. Dies wirkt sehr logisch; es wird versucht, so schnell wie möglich den e6-Bauern zu beseitigen.
 14.exf7+ [14.Qe2 is another interesting option. ist eine weitere interessante Möglichkeit.] 14...Qxf7 15.Ne4 [I thought this was necessary as Dies hielt ich für notwendig, denn nach 15.Kg1 Nf6 leaves White's knight low on options. ist der weiße Springer arm an Möglichkeiten.] 15...Nf6 16.Nxf6+ [I was reluctant to move my queen as it allows Black to castle long but after Es widerstrebte mir, meine Dame zu ziehen, da dies Schwarz die lange Rochade erlaubt, aber nach 16.Qe2 0-0-0 the computer suggestion sieht der Computervorschlag 17.Be3!? looks interesting as the knight is indirectly protected: interessant aus, da der Springer indirekt gedeckt ist: 17...Nxe4 18.Qg4+] 16...Qxf6? [I was very happy to see this recapture as Black's structural problems ensure White will always have some advantage. I was anticipating the stronger Ich war sehr froh, dieses Zurückschlagen zu sehen, denn die strukturellen Probleme von Schwarz werden dafür sorgen, dass Weiß immer gewissen Vorteil haben wird. Erwartet hatte ich das stärkere 16...exf6 17.Rh3 Be7 18.Rb3 (18.Rg3 is well met by wird gut beantwortet mit 18...f5!) 18...b6 Here Igor didn't like Hier missfiel Igor 19.Rc3 I felt during the game Ich meinte während der Partie, dass 19...0-0 20.Rxc6 Bc5 should give good compensation gute Kompensation geben sollte.; 
16...gxf6!? is also possible although then Black's king may struggle to find a comfortable home. ist ebenfalls möglich, obwohl der schwarze König dann vielleicht darum kämpfen muss, ein bequemes Zuhause zu finden.] 17.Rh3 Developing the rook along the third rank is sensible with my king already safely placed. My queen is still doing a good job preventing Black castling queenside. Den Turm über die dritte Reihe zu entwickeln, ist sinnvoll, da mein König ja bereits sicher steht. Meine Dame leistet noch immer gute Arbeit, da sie die schwarze Rochade zum Damenflügel verhindert.  17...e6 [17...e5 18.Qh5+ g6 19.Qg4 is also no picnic. ist ebenfalls kein Zuckerschlecken.] 18.Be3! Now Black has some real problems.

[Adams,Michael]

The World Team was a tough experience for me personally, and this rather fortunate win was a rare bright spot. However, my teammates' excellent play meant that we collected the silver medals in the best result for the English team in many years. 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 d5 4.Nc3 Be7 5.Bg5 I thought my opponent might look for a sharper option, but he sticks to his main opening repertoire. 5...h6 6.Bh4 0-0 7.Qc2 c5 8.dxc5 Na6 9.e3 Nxc5 10.cxd5 Nxd5 11.Bxe7 Nxe7 [11...Qxe7 12.Nxd5 exd5 would lead to a position my opponent had already reached in a couple of games with the Black pawn on h7. I wanted to avoid 13.Be2 Bg4 14.0-0 Rac8 15.Nd4 , but here 15...Ne6 16.Qd2 Qg5 as played once by Vladimir Kramnik, looks a good solution.] 12.Be2 Bd7 [Black's knight on c5 is a bit exposed, and his colleague on e7 is also not optimally placed. 12...Qb6 was probably best.; 
The natural way to develop the bishop 12...b6 13.0-0 Bb7 14.Rfd1 is a bit uncomfortable.] 13.b4 Na6 14.Qb2! [A better try than 14.a3 which I had been anticipating.] 14...Qb6 15.Rb1 Rfd8 [I need to recycle the knight from a6, but my queen is awkwardly placed after 15...Nc7 16.Ne5] 16.0-0 Rac8 [Now I didn't like 16...Nc7 17.a4 Ncd5 (but the stronger 17...Ned5! 18.a5 Qd6 gives my queen an escape route.) 18.a5] 17.Rfc1 [17.a4!? gives the option to look for mass liquidation 17...Qxb4 18.Qxb4 Nxb4 19.Rxb4 Rxc3 20.Rxb7 although this still requires care.] 17...Nc7 18.Ne5 Ncd5 19.Nc4 [19.Nxd7 Rxd7 20.Nxd5 Rxc1+ 21.Rxc1 Nxd5 22.Rc8+ Rd8 leads nowhere.] 19...Qc7 20.Ne4 Qb8 21.b5 [A good decision taking more space, 21.Ned6 Rc6 22.e4 (22.Nxf7 Kxf7 23.Ne5+ Kg8 24.Nxc6 Nxc6 is fine for Black.) 22...Nb6 23.e5 Nxc4 24.Bxc4 Nc8 25.Ne4 Nb6 swaps enough material to survive.] 21...Be8 White is a bit better, but as my last few moves were forced, this enabled me to catch up on the clock, and although my position is cramped it remains solid. 22.a4 b6 23.g3 Nf5 24.Ned2 [24.Ne5 is met by 24...Nc3 25.Rxc3 Qxe5 26.Rxc8] 24...Nf6 Dodging the fork, and trying to manoeuvre the knight towards c5. 25.Bf1 [The calm 25.Rc2! doubling rooks whilst keeping all options open looks best.] 25...Nd6 [Now 25...Nd7 26.e4! is annoying.] 26.Ne5 Nde4 27.Ndc4 [After this my knights are better placed than my opponent's. 27.Nxe4! Nxe4 28.Bg2 was the most testing aiming to land a minor piece on c6. 28...Nc3!? (28...Nc5?! 29.Rc4; 28...Rxc1+ 29.Rxc1 Nc5 30.Ra1) 29.Nxf7! (29.Rxc3 Qxe5 equalises.) 29...Nxa4 30.Qa3 Rxc1+ 31.Rxc1 Kxf7 32.Qxa4 a5! this still looks a bit shaky but the protected passed a-pawn may compensate for the other defects in my position.] 27...Nd5 28.f3?! [Finally both Black steeds have found good posts and 28.Bg2 Nc5 is nothing special. Now my opponent starts drifting, I don't like the game move weakening the kingside.] 28...Nc5 29.e4?! [Forcing matters is a sign White had not realised his edge has evaporated although 29.Qa3 f6 holds no fears for Black.] 29...Nxa4! Seizing my chance. 30.Qa3 Ndc3 31.Rxc3 Nxc3 32.Qxc3 Rc5! The point. I will win the pawn on b5 and the bishop on e8 has found a new lease of life. 33.Nd3! Rxb5 34.Rc1 Although the rook on b5 isn't under immediate threat it doesn't have any clear escape route. 34...Rc8 35.Qa3 a5 36.Qa2!? [This worked out well as we were both struggling to come to terms with the unusual nature of the position with little time to arrive at move 40. 36.Be2! so that 36...a4 can be met by 37.Bd1 was stronger.] 36...Bd7?! [Failing to understand that the queen move had freed the rook to find a better post. After 36...a4!? 37.Qxa4 Rb1 38.Qxe8+ Rxe8 39.Rxb1 b5 White's loose king means the material balance is good for Black - especially in practice. 40.Ne3 (40.Nf2 Rd8 41.Rb3 Rd4 42.Nb2 b4) 40...Rc8; 
The composed 36...Rc7!? preparing a4 is also a good idea.] 37.Rd1! Rd8 [I had intended to follow my last move with 37...e5? followed by Be6, but realised in time that 38.Nf4 exf4 39.Rxd7 fxg3 40.Nd6 is crushing.; 
37...Bc6 maintains much better co-ordination, it's important for the bishop to eye the kingside as my rook is about to be banished there.] 38.Na3 Rh5 39.g4 [39.e5! Cutting off the rook is logical , there is little choice but to play 39...b5 40.g4 Rh4 41.Qf2 g5 which doesn't inspire confidence.] 39...Rg5 40.h4? [40.e5 Bc6 was still best with all to play for. Attacking the rook looks logical but I managed to spot that the now unprotected g3 square was important.] 40...Qg3+ 41.Bg2 [41.Qg2 Qxh4 42.Nf2 Rc5 defends the rook on d8, and leaves White too much material behind.] 41...Ba4 [The most practical move, now all my pieces get active, but the mundane 41...Qxh4 was also pretty good.] 42.Nc2 [There is little hope for White.

[Simplifying the position, but after 47...Qh2! White is so passively placed it is easy to nudge the pawns forward.] 48.Kxg2 Qg5+ 49.Kh3 Rxd3 50.Qxd3 Qxc1 51.Qxb5 My technique was far from impressive, but there isn't much hope here. 51...Qf4 52.Kg2 Qd2+ 53.Kh3 Qd8 54.Qc6 g6 55.Kg4 Qd2 56.Qb5 Qc3 57.f4 Kg7 58.e5 Qd2 59.Qa4 Qb4 60.Qd1 a4 61.Qd8 Qf8 62.Qa5 Qe8!

Dreev,Alexey (2662) - Adams,Michael (2752) [E35]
EU-Cup 30th Bilbao (2.3), 15.09.2014
[Adams,Michael]

It was very enjoyable playing for SOCAR, with all my team mates in such good form during the event, and a great feeling to be a European Club Cup winner again!
 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.Qc2 d5 5.cxd5 exd5 6.Bg5 h6 7.Bh4 c5 8.dxc5 0-0! [It's strange that so few games have been played with this standard move when so many have continued with the sharp 8...g5] 9.e3 Be6 10.Nf3 Nbd7 11.Be2 Rc8 12.Nd4 [In the sixth round Alexei Shirov played the sophisticated 12.c6 here which could be a clever move. However something went wrong for him in the game continuation and after 12...bxc6 13.0-0 Qa5 14.Rac1 c5 15.Rfd1 Rfe8 16.a3 Bxc3 17.bxc3 Ne4 18.c4 Nb6 19.Nd2 Nxd2 20.cxd5 Bxd5 21.Qxd2 Qa4 I was doing well.] 12...Nxc5 13.Bxf6 Qxf6 14.0-0 Nd7 A necessary retreat: it is essential to saddle White with a weak pawn on c3 or he will take full control.
 15.Qa4 Bxc3 16.bxc3 a6 17.Qb4 Rc7 18.a4 Rfc8 19.a5 Ne5 20.Rab1 [A key moment I thought it was very important to play 20.h3 here in order to keep the bishops on the board, once my worst piece disapears, Black has an easy game as my other guys are well placed.] 20...Bg4 21.Bxg4 Nxg4 22.Ne2 Ne5 23.Rfd1 Rd7 This rook does a good job of covering my two weak points, and its colleagues, my queen and knight can target the white pawns particularly the one on a5.
 24.h3 Qd8 25.Nd4 g6 A handy move as well as preventing f5 and giving my king more breathing space, it poses the awkward question as to how White should proceed.
 26.Ra1 Rc4 27.Qa3 Qc7 It's hard to suggest improvements for White but it is clear he is being driven backwards.
 28.Rdc1 Nd3 The knight gains a tempo en route to an even better post where ...a4 and ...a4 can be menaced.
 29.Rc2 Nc5 30.Qb4 A rather beautiful move which I had completely failed to consider, the queen moves to a square where it is under attack. [The mundane 30.Qc1 Na4 was no stronger.] 30...Qd8 [White should be fine after 30...Rxb4 31.cxb4 Qd8 but of course there is no compulsion to grab the queen.] 31.Qb1 Na4 [31...Ne4 is another good option here.] 32.Nb3 [I failed to notice that following 32.Qb3 Qxa5 (Black also has the promising option to retrace his steps with 32...Nc5 33.Qb1 Ne4) 33.Nf3 Black is forced to part with the exchange although he remains in good shape after 33...b5 34.Ne5 Rd6 Possibly Dreev also wasn't aware of this as I guess it is the best try for White.] 32...Nxc3 33.Qf1 Rdc7 The rest is a matter of technique or in my case lack thereof.
 34.Qd3 Nb5 35.Rxc4 Rxc4 36.Rd1 Rc3 37.Qb1 Qd6 [In fact the sneaky 37...Qc7 is the most precise as the pawn is immune due to 38.Rxd5 Qc4] 38.Nd4 Nxd4 39.exd4 [Forced due to 39.Rxd4 Qc7 40.Rd1 Rc5] 39...Ra3 [It was not easy to choose between this and 39...Qc7 40.Qb4 just before the time control.] 40.Qxb7 Rxa5 41.Re1 Kg7 42.g3 [Survival chances are also not great after 42.Qe7 Qxe7 43.Rxe7] 42...Qf6 43.Qb2 Ra4 [During the game I regretted not playing 43...Qf3 but the machine points out that the sneaky 44.Qb8 keeps the game going.] 44.Kg2 [The best hope 44.Rd1 Qf3 is too passive.] 44...Rxd4 [I had forgotten that 44...Qxd4 45.Qxd4+ Rxd4 46.Ra1 gives White the best he can hope for, although practical results have not favoured the defender here recently.] 45.Re8 Rf4 [I managed to avoid 45...Re4 46.Rg8+] 46.Qa2 [After this the win is fairly straightforward, the best practical try was 46.Qxf6+ Rxf6 47.Rd8 d4 (47...Rf5 48.Ra8) 48.Rxd4 a5 49.Ra4 Ra6 50.Kf3 Kf6 51.Ke4 Ke6 52.Kd4 when there is still some work to be done.] 46...Qc6 47.gxf4 [47.Qb2+ is met by the deadly countercheck 47...d4+] 47...Qxe8 48.Qxd5 [The d-pawn is almost home after 48.Qxa6 Qe4+ 49.Kg3 d4] 48...Qb5 49.Qd4+ Kh7 With my king imperturbable it is impossible to prevent the pawn inching forwards.
 50.Qa7 Qd5+ 51.Kg3 a5 52.f3 Kg7 53.h4 h5 54.Qe7 [Perhaps 54.Kg2 was a little better.] 54...Qd4 This centralising move finishes the job.
 55.Qa3 [55.f5 is met by 55...Qf6] 55...a4 56.Qe7 Qg1+ 57.Kh3 Qh1+ 58.Kg3 Qg1+ 59.Kh3 Qa1 60.Kg3 a3 61.f5 a2 White resigned as 62.fxg6 Qf6 ends the argument. 0-1

After the second game, Carlsen would have been very keen to avoid Caruana demonstrating how good his preparation is again, but despite a slightly unexpected first move, he had another frustrating day with the White pieces. 1.c4 e5 [1...e6 would be an option to try to steer the game back towards the QGD of game 2.] 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.Nf3 Nc6 4.g3 d5 Although we haven't seen an Open Sicilian when Caruana is White (yet), here we get one with reversed colours. 5.cxd5 Nxd5 6.Bg2 Bc5 7.0-0 0-0 8.d3 Re8 [8...Bb6!? was played by Alexander Grischuk against Pavel Eljanov in the Geneva Grand Prix last year which brought this line to prominence.

The critical move must be 15.b5! Could 15...cxb5!? (15...axb5 16.axb5 Bd7 (16...Bh3? 17.bxc6 bxc6 18.Bxc6) 17.bxc6 Bxc6 18.Bxc6 bxc6 19.Qc2 looks no fun at all for Black. Perhaps Magnus was concerned 15.b5 would still be within his opponent's homework.) 16.axb5 a5 be Black's idea?] 15...Bd7 Preventing the b5 break for now. 16.e3 Qf6 [16...Qe7!? was also possible.] 17.Be4 Bf5 [A forcing option 17...Rad8!? still looks sensible to me.] 18.Qf3 Magnus is also happy to swap material. 18...Bxe4 19.Qxf6 gxf6 20.dxe4 Black's kingside structure is ugly but it won't be easy to get at it. 20...b5 Fixing the pawn on b4 as a target for the black bishop. 21.Red1 [Another fast move. 21.Rb2!? was another option.] 21...Bf8 22.axb5 axb5 [22...cxb5 is met by 23.Be1 Rec8 24.Rdc1 preventing the black rook getting to c4.] 23.Kg2 White's king would like to get to f5 but that's not going to happen. 23...Red8 24.Rdc1 Kg7 25.Be1 Rdc8 26.Rc2 Ra4 It's hard for White to improve as he is tied to the b4 pawn. 27.Kf3 [27.g4!?] 27...h5 A good move taking some space on the kingside. 28.Ke2 Kg6 29.h3 f5 Getting rid of the doubled pawns and improving the Black king position. 30.exf5+ Kxf5 31.f3 Be7 The position is fairly dead and the players bring proceedings to a swift conclusion. 32.e4+ Ke6 33.Bd2 [33.Rbc1 can be met by 33...Kd7 or(33...Bxb4 as in the next note.) ] 33...Bd6 34.Rbc1 Draw agreed as 34...Kd7 [Even 34...Bxb4 35.Bxb4 Rxb4 36.Rxc6+ Rxc6 37.Rxc6+ Ke7 38.Rh6 Rb2+ is fine as there is no way to hide from the checks.] 35.Rb1 repeats ½-½
